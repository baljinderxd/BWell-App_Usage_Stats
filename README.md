# BWell-App_Usage_Stats
Android app written in Java to get application usage stats for current day, yesterday and last seven days. It displays total time and top five apps used.

This application shows the total time used on foreground. And it shows top five app in the category.
For today's stats it shows a pie chart made using MPAndroid Chart.

For next two categories that is yesterday and last seven days, only total time and top five apps used with time used.
I will be adding comments in java files to explain what a specific part does and explaon other things which took me time to understand due to lack of correct information.

I created this app for the black backgroud as i didn't found any app with the same or if it was there it was not free.
Suggestions are most welcomed.

Some of the future work for this application hold:
TODOs:
1) Add custom notification
2) Add on play store
3) Precise usage Details
4) Enable donation and adds(Least Priority/Only if app is uploaded to play store)
5) PieChart for every interval
6) Add custom and monthly interval
7) Add icons with name
8) Longer list of used apps
9) Custom list for tracking app
10) Settings menu to select above modifications
11) Add good app icon xD
12) Point wise usage quality

Known Issues:
1) Wrong stats for Yesterday
2) You Tell
